# How to Use

1. Set app to open in administrator. You need to do this because all the folders are in the program files, an admin folder, which will be fixed in the next release!

# Before you report a problem with exporting
Did you set it to an administrator? 
Does the video used have captions?
Is the video a plain YouTube video, and not in a playlist?

If all these arent fixes, leave the video URL and the issue as well as, if possible, how to recreate it.
